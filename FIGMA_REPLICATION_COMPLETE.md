## How to Access in Figma

1. Open Figma Desktop
2. Your file should now contain:
   - MCP Dashboard at position (100, 100)
   - MultiTerminal at position (100, 1100)
   - UI Component Library at position (100, 2000)

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for bidirectional collaboration:
- You can modify components in Figma â†’ I'll update the React code
- You can request changes â†’ I'll propose them visually in Figma
- All components are connected to the live system

## Active Collaboration Tools

- **figma-team-mode.js**: Watching for your changes in real-time
- **figma-collab-system.js**: Managing bidirectional sync
- **WebSocket Server**: Running on port 3055 for communication

The frontend has been completely replicated to Figma with full fidelity! ðŸŽ¨
