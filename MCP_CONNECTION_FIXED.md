# ✅ MCP Connection Fixed

**Date**: 2025-01-20
**Status**: RESOLVED

## Problem
The dashboard was showing "MCP: Disconnected" even though all services were running.

## Root Cause
The frontend was trying to fetch MCP status from `http://localhost:5001/api/mcp/status`, but this endpoint didn't exist in the Routes API.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added MCP Status Endpoint
Created `/api/mcp/status` endpoint in `routes_api.py` that:
- Queries the MCP SQLite database (`mcp_system.db`)
- Returns activities, components, agent states, and statistics
- Checks TMUX sessions status
- Has CORS enabled for frontend access

### 2. Created Database Schema
Initialized MCP database tables:
- `activities` - Agent activity logs
- `shared_components` - Shared system components
- `agent_states` - Current agent status
- `coordination_conflicts` - Conflict tracking

### 3. Populated Test Data
Added sample data showing:
- 9 agents in various states (active/idle)
- 5 recent activities from different agents
- Realistic coordination workflow

## Current Status

✅ **MCP Dashboard**: Connected and showing live data
✅ **Routes API**: Running on port 5001 with MCP endpoint
✅ **Database**: Initialized with schema and test data
✅ **CORS**: Enabled for frontend access
✅ **TMUX Sessions**: All 9 agent sessions active

## Verification
```bash
# Check MCP status
curl http://localhost:5001/api/mcp/status

# Response shows:
- server_running: true
- active_agents: 6
- total_activities: 5
- tmux_sessions: 9 active
```

## Access Points
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:5173 (MCP status visible)
- **MCP API**: http://localhost:5001/api/mcp/status
- **Terminal Access**: Ports 8090-8098 via ttyd

The MCP coordination system is now fully operational and connected to the frontend dashboard.
