# Phase 9: WebSocket Transport - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented real-time WebSocket transport for MCP v2 system.

## Components Created

### 1. WebSocket Handler (`mcp_websocket_handler.py`)
- Full bidirectional WebSocket communication
- Authentication and subscription management
- Event streaming and broadcasting
- Heartbeat for connection health
- Auto-reconnection support

### 2. WebSocket Client (`mcp_websocket_client.py`)
- Interactive and automated testing modes
- Complete protocol implementation
- Event handling and streaming

### 3. Combined Server (`mcp_server_v2_websocket.py`)
- HTTP/JSON-RPC on port 8099
- WebSocket on port 8100
- Event notifications to WebSocket clients
- Unified authentication

### 4. React Hook (`useWebSocket.ts`)
- Auto-connection management
- State tracking
- Message handling
- Subscription management

### 5. UI Component (`WebSocketStatus.tsx`)
- Real-time connection status
- Event visualization
- Interactive controls
- Auto-authentication

## Features Implemented

- ✅ Stream support (logs, metrics, events)
- ✅ Broadcasting to topic subscribers
- ✅ OAuth authentication over WebSocket
- ✅ Heartbeat/keepalive
- ✅ Auto-reconnection with backoff
- ✅ Frontend integration

## Test Results

All WebSocket tests passed:
