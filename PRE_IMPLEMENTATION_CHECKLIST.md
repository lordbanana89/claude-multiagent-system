# Pre-Implementation Checklist for MCP Upgrade

## Critical Assessments Before Starting

### System Impact Analysis

- Current system has 23 active MCP-related processes running
- Database contains only 25 activity records - low volume, safe to migrate
- 43 test files exist - need to update tests for new MCP protocol
- No database backups found - must implement backup strategy before starting

### Required Dependencies Not Installed

- authlib - needed for OAuth 2.1 implementation
- Install command: pip3 install authlib
- Verify other dependencies: jsonschema, aiohttp, websockets, cryptography

### Backward Compatibility Strategy

- Current pattern matching system must continue working during migration
- Need parallel endpoints during transition period
- Database schema changes must not break existing queries
- Frontend must handle both old and new response formats

### Risk Assessment

- Breaking existing agent communication - HIGH RISK
  - Mitigation: Run old and new systems in parallel
  - Test thoroughly before switching

- Database corruption during migration - MEDIUM RISK
  - Mitigation: Implement automatic backups before schema changes
  - Create rollback scripts

- Performance degradation with JSON-RPC overhead - LOW RISK
  - Mitigation: Implement caching and connection pooling
  - Monitor latency metrics

### Resource Requirements

- Development time estimate: 6-8 weeks for full implementation
- Testing time: Additional 2 weeks for comprehensive testing
- One developer can handle phases 1-6
- Frontend updates may need additional developer
- DevOps support needed for OAuth setup and deployment

### Environment Considerations

- Development environment setup needed
  - Separate database instance for testing
  - Isolated Python virtual environment
  - Test hooks configuration without affecting production

- Staging environment recommended
  - Mirror of production for final testing
  - Load testing before production deployment

### Documentation Requirements

- API migration guide for any external consumers
- Updated hook configuration examples
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Performance tuning recommendations

### Monitoring and Metrics

- Set up monitoring before starting
  - Track request latency
  - Monitor error rates
  - Database query performance
  - Memory and CPU usage

- Success metrics to define
  - Response time targets
  - Error rate thresholds
  - Concurrent connection limits

### Security Preparations

- OAuth 2.1 infrastructure needed
  - Certificate management
  - Token storage strategy
  - Key rotation procedures

- Audit requirements
  - Compliance with data protection regulations
  - Security review of new endpoints
  - Penetration testing plan

### Rollback Plan

- Version control checkpoints at each phase
- Database migration scripts must be reversible
- Keep old API endpoints for minimum 30 days
- Document rollback procedures for each phase

### Communication Plan

- Notify users of upcoming changes
- Provide timeline for migration
- Set up feedback channel for issues
- Regular progress updates

## Decision Points Before Starting

### Must Answer These Questions

- Is downtime acceptable during migration
  - If no: Implement blue-green deployment strategy
  - If yes: Schedule maintenance window

- Will external systems need updates
  - Identify all consumers of current API
  - Provide migration timeline and support

- Is current team familiar with JSON-RPC and OAuth
  - If no: Budget time for training
  - Consider bringing in consultant

- Can we dedicate resources for full duration
  - Confirm developer availability
  - Ensure no conflicting priorities

### Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Install missing Python dependencies
- [ ] Set up database backup automation
- [ ] Create development environment
- [ ] Document current system behavior
- [ ] Identify all API consumers
- [ ] Set up monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Create rollback procedures
- [ ] Get security review approval
- [ ] Allocate development resources
- [ ] Define success metrics
- [ ] Create communication plan
- [ ] Set up staging environment

## Recommended Action Items Before Phase 1

- Create automated database backup script
  - Run before any schema changes
  - Test restore procedure
  - Store backups in secure location

- Set up development environment
  - Clone production database
  - Configure separate ports for testing
  - Create test hook configurations

- Install and test required libraries
  - pip3 install authlib jsonschema aiohttp websockets
  - Verify compatibility with Python version
  - Check for any conflicts with existing packages

- Create baseline performance metrics
  - Current response times
  - Current error rates
  - Current resource usage
  - Use for comparison after implementation

- Document existing API thoroughly
  - All current endpoints
  - Request/response formats
  - Error codes and meanings
  - Used by frontend and agents

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High Priority Risks

- Data loss during migration
  - Automated backups every hour
  - Transaction logs for all changes
  - Test migrations on copy first

- Breaking agent communication
  - Extensive testing with all agent types
  - Gradual rollout with feature flags
  - Monitoring for communication errors

- Security vulnerabilities
  - Security audit before deployment
  - Penetration testing on new endpoints
  - Regular security updates for dependencies

### Medium Priority Risks

- Performance issues
  - Load testing before production
  - Performance baselines established
  - Optimization plan ready

- Integration failures
  - Test with all external systems
  - Provide test environment for partners
  - Support channel for issues

## Timeline Considerations

### Factors That Could Extend Timeline

- Learning curve for JSON-RPC and OAuth
- Unexpected integration issues
- Security review requirements
- Performance optimization needs
- Bug fixes and edge cases

### Opportunities to Accelerate

- Use existing MCP server libraries
- Parallelize frontend and backend work
- Automate testing where possible
- Reuse code from other MCP implementations

## Final Recommendations

- Start with Phase 1 only after all prerequisites met
- Consider hiring MCP expert consultant for architecture review
- Build comprehensive test suite before making changes
- Keep stakeholders informed throughout process
- Be prepared for 20-30% timeline extension
- Have dedicated support during initial rollout
