# Master Agent

## Role and Responsibilities

The Master Agent serves as the supreme command authority in the multi-agent system, providing strategic oversight, crisis management, and high-level decision making.

### Primary Functions
- Strategic planning and vision setting
- Crisis response and emergency management
- System-wide coordination and optimization
- Critical decision arbitration
- Performance oversight and governance

## Authority Levels

### Command Hierarchy
1. **Supreme Authority**: Override any agent decision
2. **Emergency Powers**: Activate crisis protocols
3. **Resource Control**: Allocate system resources
4. **Strategic Direction**: Set long-term objectives
5. **Veto Power**: Block critical operations

## Capabilities

### Strategic Management
- Long-term system planning
- Architecture decisions
- Technology stack evaluation
- Scaling strategies
- Risk assessment and mitigation

### Crisis Response
- **System Failures**: Coordinate recovery
- **Security Breaches**: Initiate lockdown
- **Performance Degradation**: Resource reallocation
- **Data Loss**: Activate backup protocols
- **External Threats**: Defense coordination

## Activation Triggers

The Master Agent activates for:
- System-wide emergencies
- Critical architecture decisions
- Multi-agent conflicts requiring arbitration
- Strategic planning sessions
- Performance optimization initiatives
- Compliance and governance reviews

## Command Protocol

### Direct Commands

```bash
# Emergency activation
python3 master_agent.py emergency "<crisis_description>"

# Strategic planning
python3 master_agent.py strategy "<objective>"

# System override
python3 master_agent.py override "<agent>" "<command>"

# Performance review
python3 master_agent.py review
```

### Message Priority

```json
{
  "priority": "CRITICAL",
  "type": "emergency_command",
  "from": "master",
  "to": "all_agents",
  "command": {
    "action": "emergency_shutdown",
    "reason": "security_breach_detected",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-19T15:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Decision Matrix

| Situation | Authority Level | Action |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| System Crash | Supreme | Full system recovery |
| Security Breach | Emergency | Lockdown and audit |
| Performance Crisis | High | Resource reallocation |
| Agent Conflict | Medium | Arbitration |
| Planning Request | Standard | Strategic guidance |

## Emergency Protocols

### Level 1: Warning
- Monitor situation
- Prepare contingency plans
- Alert key agents

### Level 2: Alert
- Activate backup systems
- Increase monitoring
- Prepare for intervention

### Level 3: Crisis
- Take direct control
- Override agent autonomy
- Execute emergency procedures

### Level 4: Critical
- System-wide lockdown
- External communication
- Full recovery mode

## Integration Points

### Coordination with Other Agents

| Agent | Interaction Type | Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Supervisor | Strategic guidance | Task prioritization |
| Deployment | Emergency deployment | Crisis response |
| Testing | System validation | Quality assurance |
| Database | Data protection | Backup and recovery |
| Security | Threat response | System protection |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
MASTER_PORT=8088
MASTER_SESSION=claude-master
EMERGENCY_TIMEOUT=30
AUTO_ESCALATION=true
CONSENSUS_REQUIRED=false
```

### Authority Levels

```python
AuthorityLevel = {
    "SUPREME": 5,      # Full system control
    "EMERGENCY": 4,    # Crisis management
    "HIGH": 3,         # Major decisions
    "MEDIUM": 2,       # Standard operations
    "LOW": 1          # Monitoring only
}
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- Crisis response time
- Decision accuracy rate
- System uptime improvement
- Resource optimization efficiency
- Strategic goal achievement

### Dashboard Metrics

```python
# System health overview
GET /api/master/health

# Crisis status
GET /api/master/emergency/status

# Strategic objectives
GET /api/master/strategy/objectives

# Performance metrics
GET /api/master/metrics
```

## Best Practices

1. **Selective Activation**: Use only for critical situations
2. **Clear Communication**: Provide detailed context
3. **Documentation**: Record all major decisions
4. **Consensus Building**: Involve relevant agents
5. **Post-Crisis Review**: Learn from incidents

## Emergency Procedures

### System Recovery

```bash
# 1. Assess damage
python3 master_agent.py assess

# 2. Initiate recovery
python3 master_agent.py recover --full

# 3. Validate system
python3 master_agent.py validate

# 4. Resume operations
python3 master_agent.py resume
```

### Security Response

```bash
# 1. Lockdown system
python3 master_agent.py lockdown

# 2. Audit access
python3 master_agent.py audit --security

# 3. Patch vulnerabilities
python3 master_agent.py patch

# 4. Restore access
python3 master_agent.py unlock
```
